## Hardware Changes and Tests:

### Modifications Made to Board:
1. Trace from U13 Pin 8 to Stepper Motor Driver Enable Pin (A4 Pin 1) was cut.
2. Trace from 3.3V to Optical Encoder was cut.
3. Optical Encoder power is now supplied from a 5V bus.
4. U13 Pin 8 is now connected to Stepper Motor Driver Sleep Pin (A4 Pin 6).
5. Pullup resistors were added to the buffers U20, U21, U22. New buffers which do not need pullup resistors have been ordered. Resistors have been added to Pins 2,4,6,8,10,12 of each buffer.

**NOTES:**
1. Do not increase speed over 100 as it is a very powerfull motor.
2. If the direction of rotation is incorrect from the code, the wires of the motor may be dconnected to the PCB in the wrong way. To fix this, intercahnge the orientation of the wires on the PCB.

## Errors and Bugs Recorded:
1. While uploading code to the Arduino Boards, sometimes the DC Motor spins at full speed. This is potentially due to a PWM Signal being given to the motor pins during upload.
2. While uploading code to the Arduino Boards, sometimes the Stepper Motor rotates for 1 microstep in each direction continuously. This is potentially due to a PWM Signal being given to the stepper pins during upload.
3. While testing the DC Motor, the student is unable to control direction as the Supervisor is unable to perform a digitalRead on Analog Pins A0 and A1. These pins always read LOW even when the voltage on the pins is HIGH. This potentially due to an AnalogRead being called on those pins at some point in the code which causes the digitalRead values to be overwritten (This anamoly is tested and could potentially be the reason for the bug)
